# Overview

I decided to write create this program to help me understand JavaScript used as a backend language. Soon, I will start work on creating my own APIs using Node.js. This has been an excellent way for me to practice.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Visual Studio Code as me development environment. I used Node.js and Express for creating and running the program.

The program is written in JavaScript. I used the Console and the ReadLine modules of Node.js. It took me some time to figure out how to use the ReadLine module.

# Future Work

- In the future, I would love to make the story longer. I don't consider myself a good writer, but I would love to design a better story that is more interesting and exciting.
- I think it would be fun to have two or three different stories in this program, allowing the user to pick which story they want to step through.
- If I were to put this on a web server, I could add pictures that correlate to what the program is saying, giving the user a more immersive experience.
